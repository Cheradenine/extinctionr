	<h1 class="display-3 text-uppercase font-weight-bold">We Demand:</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>That the government tell the truth about the climate and wider  ecological emergency, reverse inconsistent policies and work alongside the media to communicate with citizens.</li>
    <li>That the government enact legally binding policy measures to reduce  carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and to reduce consumption levels.</li>
    <li>A national Citizenâ€™s Assembly to oversee the changes, as part of creating a democracy fit for purpose.</li>
    <li>A just transition that prioritizes the most vulnerable people and indigenous sovereignty, and establishes remediation led by and for communities suffering environmental injustice.</li>
  </ol>
